### MemoryGame
A fun .NET console application written in C# as a part of an academic course.

On start enter the names of the players or choose to play against the computer!
Then choose the width and height of the memory game board!
Enter the first tile coordinate (i.e A1, B3, B2...) you wish to reveal!
Enter the second coordinate.
Found a match? Awesome! your score is up!
Not a match? No worries just try and remember the revealed tiles!

If you chose to play against the computer watch out! He probably has a better ability to remember! :wink:

This project is done as a part of an academic course in collaboration with @itay62
